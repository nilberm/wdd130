        <h1>The Dev Mota Portfolios And Landing Page website was designed for those people who want to put their name, product, brand, company, or anything else on the internet. </h1>
        <p>Today the world is increasingly digital, no one uses paper maps to find an address anymore, they search the internet and there they get a guide to get to their destination. My goal is to do the same for you, make it possible for your customers to find you and know how they can get in touch with you because you will have your place on the internet, appearing in the first responses to surveys of websites in your field, making you stay easier to capture new customers and make your business grow.</p>
